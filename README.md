Committed to delivering excellence in Software Development  
Web | Mobile | Desktop

My name is Mitchell Quarrie, but I go by Mitch. I’m a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Information Technology from the Southern Institute of Technology (SIT).  

My interests are in all areas of programming, including but not limited to web and mobile applications and desktop development. I’m happy to be starting my career in a industry I love, and enjoy learning new languages while further perfecting my knowledge and skills in languages I’m familiar.  

I have experience in developing for a range of platforms and frameworks including Flutter, C# and React-JS.
